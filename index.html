                    Honeydukes was a wizarding sweet shop located on High Street in the
                    all-wizarding village of Hogsmeade. It was first established in 1641
                    and was owned by Ambrosius Flume and his wife, and was filled with
                    "shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable."

                    In addition to the standard wizarding candy that was sold there,
                    the owners also made their own fudge and chocolate. For obvious reasons,
                    the shop was quite a popular destination for Hogwarts students

                Honeydukes also housed the entrance to a secret passageway
                from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry directly into the cellar

                however, it was advisable only to use it to go from Hogwarts Castle
                to Honeydukes and not the other way around, due to the presence of
                a stone slide at the Hogwarts end.
